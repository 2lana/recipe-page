## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup elementary
- CSS custom properties elementary
- Flexbox elementary

### What I learned

I learned elementary of semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, flexbox.

For example, see below:

```html

<!--can be used to style elements -->
```

```css
* {
  /*Selects all elements */
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
